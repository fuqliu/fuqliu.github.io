I am Fuqiang, an about-to-graduate Ph.D. at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), CA, co-supervised by [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) and [Prof. Luis Miranda-Moreno](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/luis-miranda-moreno). Before that, I received my Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Electrical and Communication Engineering from [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/), USA, and [BIT](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), CN, respectively. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [BIT](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), CN. 

My research focuses on AI safety, specifically, to identify the potential risks hidden in AI and construct resilient solutions for practical intelligent systems.
